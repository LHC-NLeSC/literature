With the rapid development of drone recognition in the security field, there exist more and more drone recognition methods, most of which are costly and hard to implement. In the context of the rapid development of 5G technology, we propose a method utilizing the existing monitoring network to acquire data and deep learning approaches to detect drone targets to achieve drone recognizing, tracking and positioning. Our approach uses an improved CenterNet model to detect the presence of drones in the video frames. It also takes advantage of TensorRT to accelerate the inference of the trained model and abstract the spatio-temporal features of the drones in each video frame. A proportion integration differentiation (PID) framework is used to adjust the center of the camera and acquire the consequential actual coordinate to achieve positioning. We establish a largescale database, which includes 1097 images of drones in variant environments. Both the COCO2017 dataset and our drone dataset are used to test the original model and the accelerated model of resdcn101 and resdcn18, respectively. Extensive evaluations on both datasets demonstrate that the accelerated models with TensorRT can achieve a higher speed and a maintained detection precision.","2155-5052","978-1-7281-5784-9","10.1109/BMSB49480.2020.9379645","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9379645","5G;object detection;CenterNet;TensorRT;drone recognition","Target tracking;Target recognition;Life estimation;Cameras;Data models;Acceleration;Drones","5G mobile communication;aerospace communication;aerospace computing;aircraft control;collision avoidance;control engineering computing;data acquisition;deep learning (artificial intelligence);remotely operated vehicles;robot vision;tensors;three-term control;video signal processing;visual databases","drone identification;CenterNet-TensorRT;drone invasion;drone recognition;drone target detection;drone tracking;video frame;proportion integration differentiation framework;drone dataset;drone collisions;PID framework;drone positioning;COCO2017 dataset;5G technology;deep learning;data acquisition","","4","","21","IEEE","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Running state-of-the-art deep neural network (NN) based data processing on multi-core CPU processors, embedded Graphics Processing Units (GPU), Tensor Processing Units (TPU), Neural Processing Units (NPU), Deep Learning Accelerators (DLA) etc., edge devices are now able to handle heavy data computations with limited or without cloud connectivity. In addition to hardware resources, software frameworks that optimize a trained neural network (NN) model through weight clustering and pruning, weight and input-output quantization to fewer bits, fusing NN layers etc., for more efficient execution of NN inferences on edge platforms, play an important role in making machine learning at the edge (namely EdgeML) a reality. This paper is a first effort in characterizing these software frameworks for DNN inference optimizations on edge devices, especially edge GPUs which are now ubiquitously used in all embedded deep learning systems. The interactions between software optimizations and the underlying GPU hardware is carefully examined. As most NN optimization engines are proprietary softwares with undocumented internal details in the public domain, our empirical analysis on real embedded GPU platforms using a variety of widely used DNNs, provide various interesting findings. We observe tremendous performance gain and non-negligible accuracy gain from the software optimizations, but also find highly unexpected non-deterministic behaviors such as different outputs on same inputs or increased execution latency for same NN model on more powerful hardware platforms. Application developers using these proprietary software optimization engines, would benefit from our analysis and the discussed implications of our findings, with examples from real applications like intelligent traffic intersection control and Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS).

However, due to the limited computation capability of the data processing units (such as CPUs, GPUs, and specialized accelerators) in edge devices, using the devicesâ limited resources efficiently is a challenge that affects deep learning-based analysis services. This has led to the development of several inference compilers such as TensorRT, TensorFlow Lite, Relay, and TVM, which optimize DL inference models specifically for edge devices. These compilers operate on the standard DL models available for inferencing in various frameworks, e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, Caffe, PaddlePaddle, and transform them into a corresponding lightweight model. TensorFlow Lite and TensorRT are considered state-of-the-art inference compilers and encompass most of the compiler optimization techniques that have been proposed for edge computing. This paper presents a detailed performance study of TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) and TensorFlow TensorRT (TF-TRT) using commonly employed DL models for edge devices on varying hardware platforms. The work compares throughput, latency performance, and power consumption. We find that the integrated TF-TRT consistently performs better at the high precision floating point on different DL architectures, especially with GPUs using tensor cores. However, it loses its edge for model compression to TFLite at low precision. TFLite which is primarily designed for mobile applications, performs better with lightweight DL models than the deep neural network-based models. It is the first detailed performance comparison of TF-TRT and TFLite inference compilers to the best of our knowledge.","","978-1-6654-3577-2","10.1109/IPDPSW52791.2021.00128","Office of the Under Secretary of Defense; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9460587","TensorFlow-TensorRT;TensorFlow Lite;Compilers for DL;Inference at Edge","Performance evaluation;Deep learning;Tensors;Power demand;Computational modeling;Transforms;Throughput","deep learning (artificial intelligence);inference mechanisms;multiprocessing systems;neural nets;performance evaluation;program compilers","edge inference;edge computing;Deep Learning based services;computation capability;data processing units;edge devices;deep learning-based analysis services;TensorFlow Lite;DL inference models;standard DL models;lightweight model;compiler optimization techniques;detailed performance study;TensorFlow TensorRT;TF-TRT;model compression;lightweight DL models;deep neural network-based models;TFLite inference compilers","","12","","36","IEEE","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, as a consequence of the low computing power of edge devices, the detection speed of the model running on edge devices tends to be slow. Accordingly, a fast and accurate method of power line edge intelligent inspection is proposed in this article. First, for key component detection of power lines, RepVGG, diverse branch block (DBB), efficient channel attention (ECA), and improved spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) are utilized to improve YOLOv5, giving rise to RepYOLO. In addition, to solve the problem of low accuracy in pin defect detection, a two-stage cascaded method is proposed. The first stage localizes various connection fittings in the input image, and the second stage recognizes normal pins and missing pins in these connection fittings. Finally,  $\text{C}++$  language combined with TensorRT is employed to optimize and accelerate the model on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX embedded platform, fulfilling efficient power line edge intelligent inspection. Experimental results show that the TensorRT optimized RepYOLO algorithm is four times the inference speed of YOLOv5 with a 1.2% increase in accuracy. Moreover, TensorRT optimized two-stage cascaded method can achieve accurate and real-time pin defect detection on edge devices.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2022.3152855","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9722917","Edge computing;power intelligent inspection;RepYOLO;TensorRT;two-stage cascaded method","Inspection;Image edge detection;Pins;Power transmission lines;Kernel;Real-time systems;Convolution","automatic optical inspection;C++ language;cloud computing;Internet of Things;object detection;power engineering computing;power grids;power transmission lines","two-stage cascaded method;connection fittings;YOLOv5;real-time pin defect detection;edge devices;edge computing;transparent power grid;low computing power;detection speed;key component detection;efficient channel attention;power Internet of Things;power line edge intelligent inspection;RepVGG;diverse branch block;DBB;ECA;spatial pyramid pooling;SPP;RepYOLO;C++ language;TensorRT;NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX embedded platform","","7","","33","IEEE","28 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, memory usage can be reduced, and inference can be much faster by hardware acceleration when special hardware for int8 inference is provided. On the other hand, when inferences are carried out by fixed-point weights, accuracy of the model is reduced due to loss of dynamic range of the weights and intermediate layer values. For this reason, inference frameworks such as TensorRT and TensorFlow Lite, provide a function called ""calibration"" to suppress the deterioration of the accuracy caused by quantization by measuring the distribution of input data and numerical values in the intermediate layer when quantization is performed. In this paper, after quantizing a pre-trained model that performs super-resolution, speed and accuracy are measured using TensorRT. As a result, the trade-off between the runtime and the accuracy is confirmed. The effect of calibration is also confirmed.","","978-1-6654-5818-4","10.1109/ICAIIC54071.2022.9722655","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9722655","Tensor RT;Quantization;Super resolution;Real-time inference","Deep learning;Tensors;Quantization (signal);Runtime;Superresolution;Dynamic range;Calibration","computational complexity;deep learning (artificial intelligence);fixed point arithmetic;floating point arithmetic;image resolution","INT8 precision;fixed-point arithmetic;intermediate values;deep learning models;memory usage;hardware acceleration;special hardware;INT8 inference;fixed-point weights;intermediate layer values;inference frameworks;quantization;super-resolution models;floating-point value;TensorRT;TensorFlow Lite;input data distribution","","1","","12","IEEE","1 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, studies related to GPU optimization that maximize the usage of limited GPU resources are also attracting a lot of attention. In this paper, in order to maximize the GPU allocation of edge resources, we conducted some experiments to infer images of multiple frames at once, not just one input.

This work focuses on the latency difference between edge and cloud computing for smart cities, which is illustrated by a real-life example: a dash cam in a car to monitor traffic in real time. Two scenarios are compared: the first one uses a single board computer on the edge to process the data and to realise inference, whereas in the second scenario, the analysis is done in the cloud, but the result is still returned to the edge.

It is very necessary to process, store, and extract useful data at the edge of the Internet before transferring the data to central server which can be called Artificial Intelligence on The Edge.

However, real-time anomaly detection remains a challenge. Internet of Things (IoT) is an effective platform for real-time monitoring of large-scale solar farms. Using low-cost edge devices such as the Raspberry Pi (RPI), it is possible to not only read power and irradiance values from in-situ sensors, but to also apply machine learning and deep learning algorithms for real-time analysis and for detecting anomalous behaviors. This paper presents the design and implementation of an edge analytics application that uses RPI as an edge device. The Isolation Forest algorithm was first used to detect shading anomalies. A Siamese neural network was then trained to create a latent-space mapping. An anomaly detection model based on the latent space and a neural network and kNN was developed. These models could detect shading anomalies with an F1-Score of 0.94. Embedded variants of the model based on TensorFlow Lite and TensorRT were evaluated to service a large number of solar panels at 1Hz. The results are that a single RPI could do parallel anomaly detection of 512 solar panels at 1 Hz with 0% failures. The TensorRT variant consumed more resources than the TensorFlow Lite implementation, but the maximum CPU utilization remained below 75%.","","978-0-7381-2460-5","10.1109/IOTSMS52051.2020.9340189","American University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9340189","Internet of things;solar power;Siamese networks;shading;TensorFlow Lite;TensorRT;Isolation Forest","Economic indicators;Image edge detection;Real-time systems;Sensors;Solar panels;Internet of Things;Anomaly detection","computer network security;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;power engineering computing;real-time systems;solar power;solar power stations","Siamese networks;detect shading;solar power;promising sources;green power;future cities;real-time anomaly detection;IoT;real-time monitoring;large-scale solar farms;low-cost edge devices;Raspberry Pi;irradiance values;in-situ sensors;machine learning;deep learning algorithms;real-time analysis;anomalous behaviors;edge analytics application;edge device;Isolation Forest algorithm;shading anomalies;Siamese neural network;latent-space mapping;anomaly detection model;latent space;F1-Score;solar panels;TensorFlow Lite implementation;frequency 1.0 Hz","","","","51","IEEE","2 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a real-world case study on deploying a face recognition application using MTCNN detector and FaceNet recognizer. We report the challenges faced to decide on the best deployment strategy. We propose three inference architectures for the deployment, including cloud-based, edge-based, and hybrid. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of face recognition inference on different cloud-based and edge-based GPU platforms. We consider different models of Jetson boards for the edge (Nano, TX2, Xavier NX, Xavier AGX) and various GPUs for the cloud (GTX 1080, RTX 2080Ti, RTX 2070, and RTX 8000). We also investigate the effect of deep learning model optimization using TensorRT and TFLite compared to a standard Tensorflow GPU model, and the effect of input resolution. We provide a benchmarking study for all these devices in terms of frames per second, execution times, energy and memory usages. After conducting a total of 294 experiments, the results demonstrate that the TensorRT optimization provides the fastest execution on all cloud and edge devices, at the expense of significantly larger energy consumption (up to +40% and +35% for edge and cloud devices, respectively, compared to Tensorflow). Whereas TFLite is the most efficient framework in terms of memory and power consumption, while providing significantly less (-4% to -62%) processing acceleration than TensorRT. Practitioners Note: The study reported in this paper presents the real-challenges that we faced during our development and deployment of a face-recognition application both on the edge and on the cloud, and the solutions we have developed to solve these problems. The code, results, and interactive analytic dashboards of this paper will be put public upon publication.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2021.3055835","Prince Sultan University(grant numbers:SEED-2020-05); Prince Sultan University(grant numbers:SEED-CCIS-2020-05); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9350171","Cloud inference;computation offloading;edge inference;face recognition;FaceNet;jetson boards;production environment","Face recognition;Image edge detection;Deep learning;Cloud computing;Performance evaluation;Real-time systems;Visual analytics","cloud computing;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);energy consumption;face recognition;graphics processing units;optimisation","cloud devices;face-recognition application;edge deployment strategies;real-time face recognition inference;appropriate deployment strategy;face recognition application;deep learning model optimization;standard Tensorflow GPU model;edge devices;production environment;cloud-based GPU platform;edge-based GPU platform;TFLite;TensorRT optimization;energy consumption","","10","","73","IEEE","8 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The system should satisfy the following constraints:â¢There are several types of customers the system should identify and classify the current customers.â¢Each drone can carry a one/double-sided advertisement sign suitable to only one or two types of customers.â¢The system must use ultra-light drowns whose battery is limited to few flight minutes after which a hovering drone must land for recharge.â¢The system must use the minimal number of drones that are needed to maintain one drone hovering 24/7.This leads to an algorithmic problem wherein the system must decide A) when to send the hovering drone to recharge and B) which of the recharging drones should replace it. This should be done such that: 1) a maximal number of customers see a sign matching to their type, and 2) maintaining the battery power for the 24/7 mode. The proposed solution is based on a way to classify the discharging curve of the hovering-drone and the charging curve of the currently charging drones. Based on these battery statuses and the current two largest sets of customers, the system maximizes the number of customers that are matched with a suitable sign yet maintains the battery power suffices for the 24/7 hovering mode.

To accommodate high inference throughput, it is common to host a single pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in dedicated cloud-based servers with hardware accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). However, GPUs can be orders of magnitude more expensive than traditional Central Processing Unit (CPU) servers. These resources could also be under-utilized facing dynamic workloads, which may result in inflated serving costs. One potential way to alleviate this problem is by allowing hosted models to share the underlying resources, which we refer to as multi-tenant inference serving. One of the key challenges is maximizing the resource efficiency for multi-tenant serving given hardware with diverse characteristics, models with unique response time Service Level Agreement (SLA), and dynamic inference workloads. In this paper, we present PERSEUS, a measurement framework that provides the basis for understanding the performance and cost trade-offs of multi-tenant model serving. We implemented PERSEUS in Python atop a popular cloud inference server called Nvidia TensorRT Inference Server. Leveraging PERSEUS, we evaluated the inference throughput and cost for serving various models and demonstrated that multi-tenant model serving led to up to 12% cost reduction.","","978-1-7281-1099-8","10.1109/IC2E48712.2020.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9096261","DNN inference;multi-tenancy;performance","Servers;Graphics processing units;Hardware;Load modeling;Computational modeling;Throughput;Machine learning","cloud computing;convolutional neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);Python","PERSEUS;CNN models;deep learning models;convolutional neural network;graphics processing units;GPUs;multitenant inference serving;service level agreement;dynamic inference workloads;multitenant model serving;Nvidia TensorRT Inference Server;cloud inference server","","5","","42","IEEE","19 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the 2D/3D bounding box can only provide a very coarse approximation because one box often contains other targets and background. In order to solve the problem of precise target tracking and computing limitations of edge devices, this paper proposes Polarmask-Tracker, a lightweight segmentation-based multi-object tracking network for vehicular edge devices. Polarmask-Tracker extended the lightweight Polarmask segmentation head with tracking vector. The polar mask replaces the traditional mask prediction by regression of a group of fixed edge points in polar coordinate system, which can greatly optimize the computational complexity and regression difficulty of the mask. With an additional tracking vector branch generated based on mask, the model can learn tracking tasks in an end-to-end manner. Finally, we further accelerated the entire model based on TensorRT and achieve real-time tracking on mobile edge computing platform. Different from previous evaluations on the ImageNet and COCO datasets, this study uses the KITTI tracking dataset to extend the instance segmentation task to segmentation tracking, also called MOTS. At the same time, the target scales captured from the autonomous vehicle camera are usually smaller, which also brings additional challenges. Evaluations on NVidia Jetson AGX show that the final Polarmask-Tracker can achieve 122.55 FPS, 46.57 mAP for mask segmentation, 56.418 HOTA for tracking.","","978-1-6654-3574-1","10.1109/ISPA-BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom52081.2021.00100","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9644721","Segmentation;tracking;deep learning;MOTS;autonomous vehicle","Image segmentation;Target tracking;Head;Computational modeling;Soft sensors;Cameras;Real-time systems","computational complexity;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;mobile robots;object detection;object tracking;optimisation;remotely operated vehicles;robot vision;target tracking","multiobject tracking;target tracking;vehicular edge devices;edge points;polar coordinate system;computational complexity;mobile edge computing platform;KITTI tracking dataset;autonomous vehicle camera;tracking vector branch;instance segmentation;Polarmask-Tracker;TensorRT","","1","","67","IEEE","22 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These methods generally have the problems of poor robustness and insufficient ability to extract features in complex application scenarios. At the same time, convolutional neural network has not been well applied in image recognition due to its large amount of computation and slow speed.

Target detection is a key part of intelligent weapons. At present, large-scale target detection has serious challenges such as long-tail data distributions, severe occlusion, and category ambiguity. The main detection algorithms only detect each independent area without considering the key semantic dependencies between objects. It has become a hot trend to apply deep learning to prior knowledge to form a model. This article uses both internal and external knowledge to instill a target detection system with human reasoning capabilities. Commonly used external embedded knowledge includes geometric relations, attributes, locations, etc. They have a common shortcoming in that they require large amounts of labeled data, and the integration costs are huge. The purpose of this article is to construct a general external prior knowledge module to guide network learning. By paying attention to the characteristics of each object in different semantic contexts, the characteristics of each object are adaptively enhanced, and the high-level semantics of all categories evolve on a global scale. Internal knowledge uses a convolutional attention module that can learn spatial and channel information at multiple scales. The experimental results show the superiority of our knowledge-YOLOv5. The proposed method achieved 1.7%, 2.2%, 1.1%, and 0.7% improvements over YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, VOLOv51, and YOLOv5x, respectively, on the COCO data sets; and the proposed method also achieves a 0.9% improvement on the self-built data set. The trained lightweight model Knowledge-YOLOv5s is deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 through TensorRT acceleration, and the real-time detection frame is 20 ms, which meets the real-time detection requirements.

To efficiently implement DNNs on a specific FPGA platform for a given cost criterion, e.g., energy efficiency, an enormous amount of design parameters must be considered from the topology down to the final hardware implementation. Interdependencies between the different design layers must be taken into account and explored efficiently, making it hardly possible to find optimized solutions manually. An automatic, holistic design approach can improve the quality of DNN implementations on FPGA significantly. To this end, we present a cross-layer design space exploration methodology. It comprises optimizations starting from a hardware-aware topology search for DNNs down to the final optimized implementation for a given FPGA platform. The methodology is implemented in our Holistic Auto machine Learning for FPGAs (HALF) framework, which combines an evolutionary search algorithm, various optimization steps, and a library of parametrizable hardware DNN modules. HALF automates both the exploration process and the implementation of optimized solutions on a target FPGA platform for various applications.

Multiple strategies based on resolution, velocity and symmetry of faces have been applied to obtain best quality face images. The proposed system handles the issue of motion blur in the face images by determining the velocities of the detections. The output of the system is the face database, where four faces for each detected person are stored along with the time stamp and ID number tagged to it. The facial features are extracted by our system, which are used to search the person-of-interest instantly. The proposed system has been implemented in a docker container environment on two edge devices: the powerful NVIDIA Jetson TX2 and the cheaper NVIDIA Jetson N ano. The light and fast face detector (LFFD) used for detection, and ResN et50 used for facial feature extraction are optimized using TensorRT over these edge devices. In our experiments, the proposed system achieves the True Acceptance Rate (TAR) of 0.94 at False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 0.01 while detecting the faces at 20â30 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX2 and about 8â10 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson N ano device.

A prerequisite of such systems is reliable detection and classification of weeds to avoid mistakenly spraying and, thus, damaging the surrounding plants. Real-time multi-class weed identification enables species-specific treatment of weeds and significantly reduces the amount of herbicide use. Here, our first contribution is the first adequately large realistic image dataset AIWeeds (one/multiple kinds of weeds in one image), a library of about 10,000 annotated images of flax and the 14 most common weeds in fields and gardens taken from 20 different locations in North Dakota, California, and Central China.

Finally, we deploy MobileNetV2 onto our own compact autonomous robot SAMBot for real-time weed detection. The 90% test accuracy realized in previously unseen scenes in flax fields (with a row spacing of 0.2-0.3 m), with crops and weeds, distortion, blur, and shadows, is a milestone towards precision weed control in the real world.

Wearable and robotic systems use semantic information for efficient navigation or gain of contextual information. However, real-time semantic segmentation is challenging on low compute devices. We propose a compact CNN for real-time applications on low compute devices. Our decoder uses pixel shuffling to achieve efficient inferences. We compared our CNN with state-of-the-art models ranked on the Cityscapes real-time semantic segmentation category. We propose a modified Net score that includes frame per seconds to complement traditional metrics mean Intersection of Union (mIoU), the number of multiply-accumulate operations (GFLOPs), and the number of parameters to evaluate mobile computing performance. Our CNN achieved 65.7 FPS on GTX 1080, 76.7% mIoU without ImageNet pre-training, while requiring 25 GFLOPs and 4.55M parameters, resulting in a 127.53 modified Net score compared to 119.89 for Deep Dual Resolution Neural Network (DDRNET23_slim) and 115.39 for Regseg. Using the Camvid test set, our CNN performance (83.3% mIoU and 354 FPS with TensorRT) was superior to published mIoU values for Regseg and other CNNs. The accuracy and FPS on Camvid show state-of-the-art performance. To demonstrate compatibility with low compute devices, we evaluated our CNN on two mobile computing platforms and showed real-time performance (57 fps) on Jetson NX 8 GB with TensorRT and 12.65 fps on Jetson Xavier AGX without TensorRT.

One solution is to use low-dose and sparse imaging. By computationally denoising and inpainting an image with acceptable quality can be approximated. This approach, however, requires significant compute resources. Therefore, this paper proposes CELR, a framework, that hides the computationally expensive workload of reconstructing low-dose sparse SEM images, such that (delayed) live reconstruction is possible. Live reconstruction is possible by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that approximate a classical reconstruction algorithm like GOAL. The reconstruction by CNNs is done locally, while recurring training of CNNs is done in the cloud. Moreover, training labels are generated by GOAL in the cloud. Next to the framework, this paper evaluates and optimizes the CNN reconstruction throughput by employing Nvidia's TensorRT. This paper also touches upon open research questions about on-the-fly CNN training. The combination of CELR and TensorRT enables large volume acquisitions with a dwell-time of $\mathbf{1}\mu s$ and 10% pixel coverage to be reconstructed on a single GPU.","2771-2508","978-1-6654-7404-7","10.1109/DSD57027.2022.00083","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9996717","","Training;Scanning electron microscopy;Noise reduction;Graphics processing units;Imaging;Reconstruction algorithms;Throughput","","","","","","15","IEEE","4 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

After training, the improved network was evaluated using computer-simulated and tissue-mimicking phantoms, and in vivo breast ultrasound data. Our preliminary results were compared to a published 2D high-quality speckle tracking method by our group. Our preliminary results showed that the improved CNN outperformed the original Flownet 2.0. More specifically, in a tissue-mimicking phantom and one set of in vivo breast ultrasound data, the proposed CNN-based method achieved higher contrast-to-noise ratios (0.64 vs 1.05 and 1.16 vs. 1.40, respectively), as compared with the original Flownet 2.0 model. However, the improved CNN was still inferior to the coupled tracking algorithm. Currently, the inference process after the training of the proposed CNN can achieve approximately 60 frames/second for 2D speckle tracking under the NVIDIA TensorRTâ¢ framework.

Although there are many frameworks focusing on training neural networks, there are few that focus on high performance inference and visualization of medical images. Neural network inference requires an inference engine (IE), and there are currently several IEs available including Intel's OpenVINO, NVIDIA's TensorRT, and Google's TensorFlow which supports multiple backends, including NVIDIA's cuDNN, AMD's ROCm and Intel's MKL-DNN. These IEs only work on specific processors and have completely different application programming interfaces (APIs). In this paper, we presents methods for extending FAST, an open-source high performance framework for medical imaging, to use any IE with a common programming interface. Thereby making it easier for users to deploy and test their neural networks on different processors. This article provides an overview of current IEs and how they can be combined with existing software such as FAST. The methods are demonstrated and evaluated on three performance demanding medical use cases: real-time ultrasound image segmentation, computed tomography (CT) volume segmentation, and patch-wise classification of whole slide microscopy images. Runtime performance was measured on the three use cases with several different IEs and processors. This revealed that the choice of IE and processor can affect performance of medical neural network image analysis considerably. In the most extreme case of processing 171 ultrasound frames, the difference between the fastest and slowest configuration were half a second vs. 24 seconds. For volume processing, using the CPU or the GPU, showed a difference of 2 vs. 53 seconds, and for processing an whole slide microscopy image, the difference was 81 seconds vs. almost 16 minutes.

In this paper, we propose a practical object detection with scale-sensitive network.Our method first predicts a global continuous scale ,which shared by all position, for each convolution filter of each network stage. To effectively learn the scale, we average the spatial features and distill the scale from channels. For fast-deployment, we propose a scale decomposition method that transfers the robust fractional scale into combinations of fixed integral scales for each convolution filter, which exploit the dilated convolution. We demonstrate it on one-stage and two-stage algorithm under almost different configure. For practical application, training of our method is of efficiency and simplicity which gets rid of complex data sampling or optimize strategy. During testing, the proposed method requires no extra operation and is very friendly to hardware acceleration like TensorRT and TVM.On the COCO test-dev, our model could achieve a 41.5mAP on one-stage detector and 42.1 mAP on two-stage detectors based on ResNet-101, outperforming baselines by 2.4 and 2.1 respectively without extra FLOPS.","2380-7504","978-1-7281-4803-8","10.1109/ICCV.2019.00970","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9010019","","Convolution;Detectors;Object detection;Hardware;Proposals;Training;Optimization","image filtering;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;optimisation","practical object detection;scale-sensitive network;scale-sensitive object detection;scale variance;global continuous scale;convolution filter;network stage;scale decomposition method;robust fractional scale;fixed integral scales","","14","","43","IEEE","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, prior model quantization either suffers from the inefficient data encoding method thus leading to noncompetitive model compression rate, or requires time-consuming quantization aware training process. In this work, we propose a novel Adaptive Floating-Point (AFP) as a variant of standard IEEE-754 floating-point format, with flexible configuration of exponent and mantissa segments. Leveraging the AFP for model quantization (i.e., encoding the parameter) could significantly enhance the model compression rate without accuracy degradation and model re-training. We also want to highlight that our proposed AFP could effectively eliminate the computationally intensive de-quantization step existing in the dynamic quantization technique adopted by the famous machine learning frameworks (e.g., pytorch, tensorRT, etc.). Moreover, we develop a framework to automatically optimize and choose the adequate AFP configuration for each layer, thus maximizing the compression efficacy.

However, the existing methods not only suffer from the scarcity of defective samples but also their fine-grained recognition is low due to subtle differences between similar classes; furthermore, their real-time performance also needs to be improved. To solve these problems, this article presents a real-time defect detection method for track components based on instance segmentation. First, an improved lightweight instance segmentation network is proposed for the segmentation and location of fastener and rail. Second, a method that detects fastener defects by analyzing the geometric features of the fastener masks is proposed, which can overcome the scarcity of defective fastener samples. A cascade defect detection network is proposed to realize multiresolution and high-resolution detection of rail, which improves the accuracy of rail defect detection. Finally, the TensorRT inference framework is used to accelerate the defect detection network and realize edge end deployment. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve 95.1% recall rate of fastener defects, 98% detection rate of rail defects, and 93.5% classification accuracy of rail defects; 33.4 FPS defect detection speed is implemented in the Jetson AGX Xavier embedded device, which verifies the accuracy and real-time performance of the proposed method.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2021.3117357","Major Science and Technology Projects of Sichuan, China(grant numbers:20QYCX0095); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9559954","Defect detection;fastener;instance segmentation;lightweight;rail","Rails;Fasteners;Real-time systems;Image segmentation;Deep learning;Feature extraction;Performance evaluation","computer vision;condition monitoring;deep learning (artificial intelligence);fasteners;feature extraction;image classification;image segmentation;mechanical engineering computing;object detection;pattern classification;railway safety","track components;subtle difference;track defects;train operation safety;train operations;deep learning;computer vision technology;intelligent detection;defective samples;similar classes;real-time performance;real-time defect detection method;improved lightweight instance segmentation network;fastener defects;fastener masks;defective fastener samples;cascade defect detection network;rail defect detection;detection rate;rail defects;class imbalance;FPS defect detection speed;Jetson AGX Xavier embedded device","","7","","44","IEEE","5 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As such systems require high levels of resilience to errors, CNNs must execute correctly in the presence of hardware faults. Full duplication provides the needed assurance but incurs a prohibitive 100 percent overhead. In this article, we focus on algorithmically verifying convolutions, the most resource-demanding operations in CNNs. We use checksums to verify convolutions. We identify the feasibility and performance related challenges that arise in algorithmically detecting errors in convolutions in optimized CNN inference deployment platforms (e.g., TensorFlow or TensorRT on GPUs) that fuse multiple network layers and use reduced-precision operations, and demonstrate how to overcome them. We propose and evaluate variations of the algorithm-based error detection (ABED) techniques that offer implementation complexity, runtime overhead, and coverage trade-offs. Results show that ABED can detect all transient hardware errors that might otherwise corrupt output with low runtime overheads (6-23 percent). Only about 1.4 percent of the total computations in a CNN are not protected by ABED, which can be duplicated for full CNN protection. ABED for the compute-intensive convolutions and duplicating the rest can offer at least 1.6Ã throughput compared to full duplication.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2021.3063083","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9366780","Resilience;hardware error detection;convolutional neural networks","Hardware;Safety;Runtime;Resilience;Training;Inference algorithms;Computational modeling","convolutional neural nets;fault tolerant computing;parallel processing;safety-critical software","CNN;reduced-precision operations;ABED;compute-intensive convolutions;convolutional neural networks;safety-critical system;high-performance computing system;hardware faults;convolution resilient;algorithm-based error detection;multiple network layer fusion","","6","","40","IEEE","2 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose to finetune and quantize a well-trained FPN convolutional network to obtain an integer convolutional network. Our key idea is to adjust the upper bound of a bounded rectified linear unit (ReLU), which replaces the normal ReLU and effectively controls the dynamic range of activations. Based on the tradeoff between learning ability and quantization error of networks, we managed to preserve full accuracy after quantization and obtain efficient integer networks. Our experiments on ResNet for image classification demonstrate that our 8-bit integer networks achieve state-of-the-art performance compared with Google's TensorFlow and NVIDIA's TensorRT. Moreover, we experiment on VDSR for image super-resolution and on VRCNN for compression artifact reduction, both of which serve regression tasks that natively require high inference accuracy.

Industrial drones leverage fully-fledged computer vision techniques, such as object detection based on Deep Learning Neural Networks (DNN), to efficiently perform these objectives. Those techniques come with a high computational effort and are implemented on distributed schemes using ground devices with high performance and power consumption. This limits a drone's operational range since it has to communicate with the ground devices constantly. To alleviate such constraints, an optimized, low-power perception system on the drone is desirable. This work improves a trained DNN architecture to navigate a UAV introduced by the University of Zurich called DroNet. DroNet is computationally expensive and has a high power consumption, making it unsuitable for embedded platforms because of low memory and computational power. In this paper, a ROS-based architecture is first designed to port DroNet on a low-power Jetson Nano board, which conducts the drone's perception and control tasks. Secondly, tuning parameters and various schemes have been carried out to run the inference of the DNN efficiently. To implement the different layers in DNNs, Nvidia's TensorRT SDK is used to compile a high-performance inference engine for the Jetson Nano. Results showed that the Jetson Nano can achieve real-time performance, with 47 frames per second using a Winograd convolution and well-tuned parallelization parameters. The implementation can also achieve a speedup of 2Ã as compared with the Jetson Nanos ARM CPU while increasing the power consumption by 54%. Finally, the Jetson Nano's usability for drone inference algorithm is shown, achieving real-time response using the DroNet DNN without losing detection accuracy.","","978-1-7281-2989-1","10.1109/ETFA45728.2021.9613590","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9613590","drones;Jetson Nano;low power deep learning;deep learning;neural networks;object detection","Performance evaluation;Deep learning;Power demand;Estimation;Object detection;Real-time systems;Inference algorithms","autonomous aerial vehicles;computer vision;graphics processing units;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;object detection;object recognition;parallel architectures","optimized Deep Learning object recognition;embedded GPU;surveillance;transportation;industrial drones leverage;computer vision techniques;object detection;Neural Networks;high computational effort;distributed schemes;ground devices;low-power perception system;trained DNN architecture;high power consumption;embedded platforms;low memory;computational power;ROS-based architecture;port DroNet;low-power Jetson Nanoboard;high-performance inference engine;real-time performance;Jetson Nanos ARM CPU;Jetson Nano's usability;drone inference algorithm;DroNet DNN","","1","","27","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, they suffer from complicated hand-designed components and tedious post-processings. It is not easy to adjust parameters for unique scenes in real applications. So, we propose a new scheme by formulating visual tracking as a direct set prediction problem to alleviate this issue. The main component is a transformer attached to the Siamese-type feature extraction networks. Thus, our new framework can be summarized as Siamese Network with Transformers (SiamTFR). With a fixed small set of learned object queries, we force the final set of predictions via bipartite matching, significantly reducing hyper-parameters associated with the candidate boxes. Due to the unique predictions of this framework, we significantly ease the heavy burden of hyper-parameters search of post-processings in visual tracking. Extensive experiments on visual tracking benchmarks, including GOT-10K, demonstrate that SiamTFR achieves competitive performance and runs at 50 FPS. Specifically, SiamTFR outperforms leading anchor-based tracker SiamRPN++ in the GOT-10K benchmark, confirming its effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, SiamTFR is deployed on the embedded device in which the algorithm can be run at 30FPS or 54FPS with TensorRT meeting the real-time requirements.

To this end, we introduce E.T. that rE-thinks self-attention computation for Transformer models on GPUs with the following contributions: First, we introduce a novel self-attention architecture, which encompasses two tailored self-attention operators with corresponding sequence length-aware optimizations, and operation reordering optimizations. Second, we present an attention-aware pruning design which judiciously uses various pruning algorithms to reduce more computations hence achieves significantly shorter turnaround time. For the pruning algorithms, we not only revamp the existing pruning algorithms, but also tailor new ones for transformer models. Taken together, we evaluate E.T. across a variety of benchmarks for Transformer, BERTBASE and DistilBERT, where E.T. presents superior performance over the mainstream projects, including the popular Nvidia Enterprise solutions, i.e., TensorRT and FasterTransformer.","2167-4337","978-1-4503-8442-1","10.1145/3458817.3476138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9910069","","Deep learning;Tensors;Computational modeling;High performance computing;Computer architecture;Benchmark testing;Transformers","","","","","","63","","18 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although recent research has proposed ways of quickly estimating latency on unseen hardware devices with just a few samples, little focus has been given to the challenges of estimating latency on runtimes using optimized graphs, such as TensorRT and specifically for edge devices. As devices like NVIDIAâs Jetsons get more popular in embedded computing and robotics, we observe a pressing need to more accurately estimate inference latency of neural network architectures on diverse runtimes, including highly optimized ones. In this work, we propose MAPLE-Edge, an edge device-oriented extension of MAPLE, the state-of-the-art latency predictor for general purpose hardware, where we train a regression network on architecture-latency pairs in conjunction with a hardware-runtime descriptor to effectively estimate latency on a diverse pool of edge devices. Compared to MAPLE, MAPLE-Edge can describe the runtime and target device platform using a much smaller set of CPU performance counters that are widely available on all Linux kernels, while still achieving up to +49.6% accuracy gains against previous state-of-the-art baseline methods on optimized edge device runtimes, using just 10 measurements from an unseen target device. We also demonstrate that unlike MAPLE which performs best when trained on a pool of devices sharing a common runtime, MAPLE-Edge can effectively generalize across runtimes by applying a trick of normalizing performance counters by the operator latency, in the measured hardware-runtime descriptor. Lastly, we show that for runtimes exhibiting lower than desired accuracy, performance can be boosted by collecting additional samples from the target device, with an extra 90 samples translating to gains of nearly +40%.","2160-7516","978-1-6654-8739-9","10.1109/CVPRW56347.2022.00410","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9857090","","Performance evaluation;Training;Runtime;Linux;Neural networks;Computer architecture;Pressing","computer vision;deep learning (artificial intelligence);embedded systems;graph theory;Linux;neural net architecture;optimisation;regression analysis","MAPLE-Edge;hardware-runtime descriptor;runtime latency predictor;neural architecture search;neural network architectures;embedded vision application;hardware devices;optimized edge device runtimes;mobile vision application;optimized graph;NVIDIA Jetsons;regression network;CPU performance;Linux kernel","","","","26","IEEE","23 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this issue, firstly we adopt an improved cross entropy loss function and data augmentations to rebalance the data distribution. Then the extra datasets are involved to neutralize the low images quality and annotation inconsistency issues. Secondly, this competition focuses on object detection on embedded device. So we apply knowledge distillation to fine-tune a lightweight detection model. Our detection model uses MobileNetV3 Small as backbone and SSDLite as detector head. In order to improve detection performance on small targets, FPNLite is included so that low-level features can be utilized.

Based on an active learning strategy, we first annotate and construct a FluoPhyto dataset of red tide phytoplankton species fluorescence images commonly found in the South and East China Sea, which contains a total of 30,339 images in 32 different categories. Using the dataset, we train the Faster-RCNN, SSD, YOLOv3 and YOLOX networks, and the comparison result shows that the performance of YOLOX network outperforms the other networks, which can reach a mean average precision (mAP) of 90.9%. The trained YOLOX model is then deployed on an embedded GPU module and the inference speed is tested to reach 20 fps with the help of TensorRT optimization, which can hopefully meet the real-time detection requirements of the instrument. In addition, the algorithm is run on the embedded platform for detection of images collected in a red tide event that happened near the Pearl River Estuary, and the key parameters such as abundance and size spectrum of the dominant species, Cochlodinium geminatum, are obtained, which confirms the feasibility and superior performance of the detection algorithm.","","978-1-6654-1821-8","10.1109/OCEANSChennai45887.2022.9775330","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9775330","phytoplankton;object detection;imaging flow cytometry;machine vision;embedded system","Statistical analysis;Imaging;Object detection;Fluorescence;Real-time systems;Inference algorithms;Rivers","ecology;fluorescence;geophysical image processing;image sensors;learning (artificial intelligence);microorganisms;object detection;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;oceanography;river pollution;rivers;seawater;tides;underwater optics","real-time analysis;marine phytoplankton images;high frame rate;YOLOX-based object detection algorithm;phytoplankton cells;natural seawater;marine ecological science research;harmful algae bloom monitoring applications;YOLOX network-based object detection algorithm;phytoplankton fluorescence images;imaging flow cytometer;active learning strategy;FluoPhyto dataset;red tide phytoplankton species;mean average precision;trained YOLOX model;real-time detection requirements;red tide event","","","","31","IEEE","19 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose reliable integration of multi-face recognition system into compact and low-power edge devices. The deployed inference system uses a novel and light-weight face detector âFaceBoxesâ, which is used for multi-face detection and extraction. âFaceNetâ is used as a face recognizer which outputs 128-dimensional embedding as feature vectors which is fed to a âMultilayer Perceptron (MLP)â for face classification. We analyze the performance of facial recognition inference system on the two NVIDIA Jetson Edge computing boards (Nano, TX2). We also compare the performance of a TensorRT-based deep learning model optimization against a typical Tensorflow model implementation. The paper provides a detailed benchmarking analysis in terms of accuracy, FPS, execution time, memory usage and energy consumption. Additionally, the performance of the proposed face recognition system is compared with the state-of-the-art Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Network (MTCNN) based face recognition system.

Next, the lane-line detection model output is utilized to estimate the next destination for the self-driving automobile, and then we converted the model to TensorRT pattern with Float16 format. Depending on the result of the lane-line detection model, we designed a strategy to control the steering wheel through a DC Servo motor.

The architecture consists of three parts: a human detection and tracking network, a key frame extraction function, and a HAR network. The HAR network is a cascade of a DenseNet121 and a double-layer bidirectional long-short-term-memory (DLBiLSTM), in which the DenseNet121 is a pretrained model to extract spatial features from action key frames and the DLBiLSTM provides a deep two-directional LSTM inference to classify complicated time-series human actions.
